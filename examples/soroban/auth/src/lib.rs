//! This contract demonstrates how to implement authorization using
//! Soroban-managed auth framework for a simple case (a single user that needs
//! to authorize a single contract invocation).
//!
//! See `timelock` and `single_offer` examples for demonstration of performing
//! authorized token operations on behalf of the user.
//!
//! See `atomic_swap` and `atomic_multiswap` examples for demonstration of
//! multi-party authorizaton.
//!
//! See `account` example for demonstration of an acount contract with
// lib.rs
